Inspect: the characters are careful, meticulous, and make sure nothing is out of place at the end of their search. This takes time and skill, though skill can be substituted for more time if necessary.
Search: the characters look through a location. Anyone intimately familiar with the location will recognize that things have been moved and someone has been here. This takes time.
Ransack: the characters rifle through things. They leave the area in shambles. This draws attention.
