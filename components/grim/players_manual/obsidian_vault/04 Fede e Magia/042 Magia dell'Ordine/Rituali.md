This ritual encircles a target and releases their spirit from their
body. While free, their spirit can roam the world unfettered and is
protected from other spirits. If the circle is damaged, other spirits
may possess the body. If this happens, or if the target’s body is
removed from the circle for any reason, their spirit cannot return

Place your arcane sigil on a material possession of a deceased
target to summon their ghost. You may converse with them freely,
but the ghost may leave if offended or bored.
